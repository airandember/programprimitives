# ProgramPrimitives Context Documents

This folder contains the governing context and vision documents for ProgramPrimitives. These are the **source of truth** for product decisions.

## Documents

### [CURRICULUM_HIERARCHY.md](./CURRICULUM_HIERARCHY.md)
The complete tool hierarchy from absolute beginner (Tier 0) to elite competition level (Tier 12). Defines:
- All primitive tiers and their relationships
- Prerequisite chains
- Tool refinement paths
- Difficulty calculations
- Badge categories
- Implementation priorities

### Future Documents

- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — UI/UX patterns, component library
- `API_CONTRACTS.md` — Backend API specifications
- `CONTENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` — Writing standards for lessons
- `CODE_QUALITY_METRICS.md` — How we score user code

## Usage

Before implementing any curriculum-related feature:
1. Check `CURRICULUM_HIERARCHY.md` for tier/prerequisite info
2. Ensure changes align with the tool refinement philosophy
3. Update the context doc if decisions change

## The Core Vision

> **You don't become a master craftsman by buying better tools — you earn refined tools through mastery of the basics.**

Every feature should support this metaphor:
- Users **refine** their tools through practice
- Higher-level tools are **unlocked** by demonstrating mastery
- Progress is visualized as **tool upgrades**, not just completion percentages

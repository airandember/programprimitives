Let's reshape the future of coding education — not by teaching syntax, but by teaching the universal tools that make coding possible. Let’s build the toolbox that every coder, beginner or expert, will reach for.

Imagine a platform where coding isn’t taught as endless syntax, but as universal tools. At ProgramPrimitives.com, we strip programming down to its core primitives — loops, arrays, conditionals, functions — the levers and gears of code itself. Whether you’re brand new or a seasoned developer, you subscribe, practice, and master these building blocks, then choose the language you want to apply them in. Unlike traditional sites that lock you into one language, we teach the tools first — giving you fluency across any language, and the confidence to build anything. ProgramPrimitives.com: master the physics of code, not just the vocabulary.

We’re building ProgramPrimitives.com — a platform that teaches coding at its most fundamental level. Instead of focusing on syntax of one language, we teach the universal tools of programming: loops, arrays, conditionals, functions, and progressively advanced constructs. Users then choose the language they want to practice those tools in. Our mission is to make coding fluency portable across languages. Now we need builders who want to shape the future of coding education — not by teaching syntax, but by teaching the universal tools that make coding possible. Let’s build the toolbox that every coder, beginner or expert, will reach for. New class with a new language? No problem, sharpen your tool set in that language. Applying to a job that is using a specific syntax you don't have experience in? No big deal, you know the tools and can now practice progressively more advanced tools to handle any situation easily!

2. Why It Matters
- Beginners → Learn the “physics of code” without being overwhelmed by syntax wars.
- Experienced devs → Sharpen fundamentals, cross-train in new languages faster.
- Differentiator → Unlike Codecademy or LeetCode, we’re tool-first, language-second.

3. Core Features
- Interactive practice modules for primitives (loops, arrays, conditionals, etc.).
- Language selector → Apply the same primitive in Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.
- Progressive difficulty → From basics to advanced constructs (recursion, concurrency).
- Gamified mastery → Badges, streaks, and challenges.
- Subscription model → Sustainable revenue with tiered access.

4. Teaching Approach
- Industry Standards First → Every exercise highlights best practices: clean code, readability, and bug prevention.
- Do’s and Don’ts → Show examples of common pitfalls (e.g., confusing loop indices, poor naming) alongside recommended solutions.
- Contextual Linking → In a “for loop” exercise, users see links to related primitives (“for loops,” “parsing,” “arrays”) with explanations of human tendencies to watch out for and why industry standards exist.
- Style Recognition → The platform adapts to a user’s coding “dialect” (e.g., variable naming, indentation style) while nudging them toward normalized practices.
- Strength Scoring System → Users receive scores measuring clarity, efficiency, and adherence to standards, helping them track growth and mastery.
- Healthy Habits → Encourage practices like modularity, commenting, and error handling early on, so users build professional habits from day one.

5. Technical Scope
- Frontend: Lightweight, responsive UI: Svelte.
- Backend: API-driven, modular design for exercises and language runtimes: GO lang hosted in cloudflare.
- Sandboxing: Secure execution environments for multiple languages.
- Persistence: Track user progress, achievements, and subscriptions.
- Scalability: Cloud-native, serverless where possible to keep costs lean.
